- Markdown can be used to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Markdown is portable. Files containing MD-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
- Markdown is platform independent. One can cretate MD-formatted text on any device running any operating system.  
- Markdown is future proof. One will still be able to read ones' MD-formatted text using a text editing application even if the application one is using stops working at some point in the future.

### Content

Markdown is a unique markup language. In that, when one create a MD-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For instance, to denote a heading, one is required to add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after (**this text is bold**).
